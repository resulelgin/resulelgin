Hi! My name is Resul Gökberk Elgin. I am a Turkish molecular biologist. Currently, I am a PhD student in EMBL Heidelberg. I developed a keen interest in computational biology and gut microbiome during my Master studies. I am determined to combine dry and wet lab skills to gain further insights in the host-microbe associations. You are welcome to check my Masterthesis repository to see the scripts I have been using for my thesis.
